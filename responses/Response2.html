				<h1>Designer as Author.</h1>


				<p>In his essay “The Designer as an Author” (1996) published in Multiple Signatures: On Designers, Authors, Readers and Users (2013), Michael Rock, Graphic Designer and founding partner and creative director of 2×4 in New York City, writes about the meaning and value of authorship in design culture</p>


				<p>In the first part of the essay he examines the term “authorship” in the historical and present context, its changing meaning over time and the effect it has had on the author-text-relationship and the reader’s interpretation of a text and how it all connects to the design process.</p>


				<p>He explains the tension between claiming ownership over a message and the reader’s free interpretation leaving a text anonymous.</p>


				<p>A contrast pointed out by Michael Rock is the “Auteur Theory”, originated in the French film criticism that attributes sole control and ultimate power over a project to the director.</p>

				<p>The connection to Graphic Design is easily made as authorship over a project brings out a different meaning to it than producing a piece of art for the sake of it or following someone’s instructions.</p>
