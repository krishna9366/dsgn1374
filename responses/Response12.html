				<h1>The Crystal Goblet</h1>
				<p>In her essay, The Crystal Goblet, Beatrice Warde is intending to convey and break down the message that typography is more technical than simply slapping words in a document.  She begins with a comparison between the decisions of a true wine connoisseur or a wine amateur.  A wine amateur would choose to drink their wine out of a clunky, solid gold goblet because it has more price value, but a wine connoisseur would choose a glass made of very thin crystal so as to not hide the delicacy and apparent features of the wine. Warde then continues to explain the reasoning and comparison of her metaphor.</p>

				<p>Apart from her solid gold versus crystal goblet metaphor, and paralleling it with typographic skill, Warde informs the reader of the necessity of having specific guidelines and rules set for the practice of typography.  Her parallel between the two is that the spoken language, if not somehow understood, will ultimately leave a lack of understanding and disengage the listener, much like the loss of interest in a reader who looks at a visually displeasing work of type.</p> 

				<p>In her essay, Warde compares two significant topics to the readability of type in order to support her purpose.  The first being the connection between type skills and the clunky, golden goblet versus a smooth, thin, clear crystal goblet.  Typography, much like the significant features of a crystal wine glass, takes into account the necessity of a clean-looking page that is able to convey the message it is intending to.  Moreover, the designs of many crystal goblets are so delicate that the connoisseur is fearful of its ability to break in an instant.  Similarly, typographers create works that leave the reader cautious of type in close range or words that may end up becoming one.</p>
